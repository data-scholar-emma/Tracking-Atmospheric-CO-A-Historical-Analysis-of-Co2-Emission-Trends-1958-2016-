# Tracking-Atmospheric-CO-A-Historical-Analysis-of-Co2-Emission-Trends-1958-2016-
This data science research project investigates the long-term trends in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentrations from 1958 to 2016.


## Project Overview
This data science research project investigates the long-term trends in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentrations from 1958 to 2016.

Utilizing high-resolution time-series data from the Mauna Loa Observatory and other verified sources, the project explores the seasonal and annual patterns of CO₂ emissions over nearly six decades.

Through trend analysis and robust data visualization, the study provides compelling evidence of the accelerating rise in CO₂ levels driven by anthropogenic activity.

By presenting clear, data-backed insights into historical CO₂ emissions, this project aims to inform public discourse, support environmental advocacy, and encourage policy interventions for climate action.

### Objectives
- To analyze the trend of atmospheric CO₂ concentrations from 1958 to 2016.

- To quantify the annual growth rate in CO₂ levels.

- To communicate findings using visualizations that are accessible to both scientific and non-scientific audiences.

### Data Source
**Mauna Loa Observatory CO₂ Data:** Provided by NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/)


### Methodology
- Loaded the data from a CSV file into a Pandas Dataframe

- Converted the data into time-series format for seasonal decomposition

- Handled missing values and smoothed data using rolling averages

- Visualized the data to uncover the trend in co2 emmision from 1958 to 2016.

  ### Data Pre-Processing

  The dataset is provided by NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/),  contains records of the change in climate in the last half a century or so. 

The data is in a CSV file called `climate_change` with three columns. 

- 1. The `"date"` column indicates when the recording was made and is stored in the year-month-date format.
     A measurement was taken on the 6th day of every month from 1958 until 2016. 


- 2. The  `"co2"` column contains measurements of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
     The number shown in each row is parts-per-million of carbon dioxide. 


- 3. The  `"relative_temp"` column denotes the temperature measured at this date, relative to a baseline which is the average        temperature in the first ten years of measurements.
 
### Data Loading 

```python
# solution 

import pandas as pd 

climate_change_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/User/Downloads/climate_change.csv")

climate_change_df.head()
